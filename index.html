        <h3><u>How To NOT Go To SnapCity</u></h3>
        <ol class="lists">
          <li>Practice deadlifting with a straight back. If you can't maintain this form, it means you're lifting too much weight.</li>
          <li>Lay on a bench with a flat back and pinch your shoulder blades togther. This will create a mild natural arch in your back, which is fine.</li>
          <li>With all other exercises, be sure to not lift more weight than you can safely handle. If you can't maintain proper form, lower the weight!</li>
        </ol>
